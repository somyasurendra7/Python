# Python Crash Course - Chapter 12

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at
the bottom center of the screen.
The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen.
The player shoots and destroys the aliens.
If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.
If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.
If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

## Phase 2

• Examine our code and determine if we need to refactor before implementing
new features.
• Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen with appropriate
spacing around it.
• Use the spacing around the first alien and the overall screen size to
determine how many aliens can fit on the screen. We’ll write a loop to
create aliens to fill the upper portion of the screen.
• Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot
down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground. If the
whole fleet is shot down, we’ll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the
ship or the ground, we’ll destroy the ship and create a new fleet.
• Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when
the player has used up the allotment of ships.
